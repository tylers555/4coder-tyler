# 4coder-tyler

This fork of the 4coder code base contains some bug fixes, as well as the code for my customizaiton layer. 
This repository also contains 4coder-non-source, which was originally needed to build the program. 
As such, this would be the only repository needed to be downloaded in order to be built.

## Customization layer
The customization layer is based upon [Ryan Fleury's custom layer](https://github.com/Dion-Systems/4coder_fleury)

- Contains multiple languages. Some languages introduce additional syntax highlighting, and use the code index.
    - C/C++, this also includes syntax highlighing for similar languages. From 4coder_fleury.
    - Metadesk, Ryan Fleury's language for metaprogramming. From 4coder_fleury.
    - JAI, Jonathan Blow's new programming language. From 4coder_fleury.
    - GLSL, this includes syntax highlighting for keywords, as well as uniform ins and outs.
    - SJA, my own custom format for defining assets
    - Batch, batch files are now syntax highlighted
- The lister for searching the code index now has color depending on the code index note. The entire line is now also displayed for each note.
- Different modes for listing, based on file type, current file, and only definitions(useful).
- Text fade in and out for copy/paste/ctrl+delete

## Bug fixes
- Fixed copy/paste bug

## Build Instructions for everything
The build currently is only configured for Windows.

1. Download/clone the repository.
2. On windows setup the visual studio command line magic sauce so that "cl" works
3. There are two modes for building:
   - On windows run "bin\build.bat" this will make an unoptimized build
   - On Windows run "bin\build_optimized.bat" this will make an optimized build

## Notes on Major Issues (from Allen Webster)

1. The build system and organization of files is extremely complicated. There is a 4ed_build.cpp that defines how builds run, and the build scripts have to build and run this C++ file. The file is pretty chaotic since it cannot rely on the codebase's usual helpers. On top of that there is a totally separate build system for the custom layer which is also a big gigantic mess of its own. It involves several stages of compilation, and a number of metaprograms.

2. The documentation system is over complicated & the documentation is incomplete. There is very little documentation for the internals or the complicated layers of helpers.

3. The lexer generator is way too complicated, and the built-in support for language features is not fully developed. The background threaded parsing is not very carefully organized and is not very flexible, so it's hard to add new languages at any level of the system.

4. There are a few layers of overcomplicated configuration parsers.

5. Mac support has not been maintained for several versions.

6. The codebase has a very weak base layer with key features that were added very late, so lots of code was written in the absence of useful features to bind things together. To make matters worse the base layer is split by the distinction of custom layer & core layer, leading to some double definitions and some incosistencies.
